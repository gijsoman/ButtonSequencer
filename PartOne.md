As promised we will first take a look at the end result.

## Result

As you can see here there are three buttons that have to be pressed. Each button corresponds to a button on the Xbox Controller. If the correct button is pressed it will disappear and the next button can be pressed. 

### Features

- Sequence resetting when a wrong button is pressed.
- Sequence timers. A countdown time within which the sequence need to be completed.
- Button Timers. A countdown time within which the button has to be pressed.
- Random Buttons so you don't have to create all the sequences yourself.



## Downloading and Importing the Unity Package

1. Download the Unity Package. As mentioned before this can be done here: https://github.com/gijsoman/ButtonSequencer

2. Open Unity or Unity Hub and create a new project in Unity 2018.3.7f1 or higher (NOTE: older versions probably work but they aren't tested with this package)
