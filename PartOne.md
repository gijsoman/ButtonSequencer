# Intro

Hey there! My name is Gijs Bakker(24). During a school project I was working on a game that made use of button sequences. A sequence of buttons that had to be pressed in the right order to be completed. You can compare this to something like a quick-time event. To make it easy for myself I created a tool which allowed me to make those button sequences. 

In this tutorial I will teach you how to use this tool so you can use them to intergrade button sequences into your own game. There are going to be multiple parts of this tutorial. The first part is going to show you how to set this tool up for one button sequence. The second part is going to show you how you can make use of multiple button sequences. A sequence of sequences. Each part will start with the result so you can directly see if this is what you are looking for.

**DISCLAIMER:** in the first two parts of this tutorial I will only show functionality with an XBOX one controller. Maybe in the future there will be support for other controller-types but if this disclaimer is still visible there isn't any yet.

## Requirements

For this tutorial there are a couple of things you need:

- Unity 2018.3.7f1 or higher
- An Xbox One Controller
- A copy of my Unity Package which can be donwloaded here: https://github.com/gijsoman/ButtonSequencer

Besides that you need a basic programming skill.

- You need to know how to make a function

## Part One: Set-up for one button sequence
